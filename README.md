# Junior React Developer Test - ecommerce app (by Sheilla Mirembe)

Hello there! :)  Thanks for taking the time to review my test project.


## About the Repository
This repository contains 2 branches, the main and not-persistent-store branch.
The only difference between the two is that the not-persistent-store branch contains an earlier version of the app, where items added to the cart do not persist on page reloads. 

## Getting started
Please check out the get-started.md file on this repository.
