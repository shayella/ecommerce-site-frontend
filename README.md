# Junior React Developer Test - ecommerce app (by Sheilla Mirembe)

Hello there! :)  Thanks for taking the time to review my test project.


## About the Repository
This repository contains 2 branches, the main and persistent-store branch.
The only difference between the two is that the persistent-store branch contains a persistent version of the app, where all items added to the cart persist on page reloads.

## Getting started
Please check out the get-started.md file on this repository.
